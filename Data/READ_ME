Necessary data to replicate the analysis


The mother data is rndpts_genus_form

It is recommended to run the script in the following order: 

First: "Data_Vis_Graphs_Bayesian_Preparation.R"

Second: "Preparation_Species_Distribution_Model.R"

Third: "Visual_Correlations_Depths.R"

Fourth: "Depth_Distribution_Plots.R"

Five: "Visual_PCA_Environment_Scleractinia.R"

Sixth: "Bayesian_models.R"

Seventh: "Species_Distribution_model.R"

Yet, every script is independent and can be run alone. 
Scripts are simplified to reproduce the figures and analysis of the study.
